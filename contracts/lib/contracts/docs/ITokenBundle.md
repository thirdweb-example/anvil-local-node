# ITokenBundle





Group together arbitrary ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens into a single bundle.  The `Token` struct is a generic type that can describe any ERC20, ERC721 or ERC1155 token.  The `Bundle` struct is a data structure to track a group/bundle of multiple assets i.e. ERC20,  ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens, each described as a `Token`.  Expressing tokens as the `Token` type, and grouping them as a `Bundle` allows for writing generic  logic to handle any ERC20, ERC721 or ERC1155 tokens.
