For auctions: if                               `buyoutPricePerToken` is greater than 0, and a bidder&#39;s bid is at least as great as                               `buyoutPricePerToken * quantityToList`, the bidder wins the auction, and the auction                               is closed. |
| _currencyToAccept | address | For direct listings: the currency in which a buyer must pay the listing&#39;s fixed price                               to buy the NFT(s). For auctions: the currency in which the bidders must make bids. |
| _startTime | uint256 | The unix timestamp after which listing is active. For direct listings:                               &#39;active&#39; means NFTs can be bought from the listing. For auctions,                               &#39;active&#39; means bids can be made in the auction. |
| _secondsUntilEndTime | uint256 | No. of seconds after the provided `_startTime`, after which the listing is inactive.

For auctions: &#39;inactive&#39; means bids can no longer be made in the auction. |
